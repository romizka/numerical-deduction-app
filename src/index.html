          This tests how easily you think with numbers. You are given a series
          of numbers. Your task is to see how they go together to form a
          relationship with each other. You then have to choose the number which
          would go next in the series, choosing from the four possible answers
          provided. It is advisable to have a piece of scrap paper and a pencil
          to do any working out that may be necessary. Mark the correct answer.
        </p>

        <div class="introduction__example">
          <h2 class="introduction__example-number">Example 1</h2>
          <p class="introduction__example-task">2 4 6 8 10 ?</p>
          <p class="introduction__answer">A. 11 B. 20 C. 12 D. 18</p>
          <p class="introduction__example-explanation">
            Answer C is correct. Explanation: the numbers are a series. The next
            one in the series should be 2 more.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="introduction__example">
          <h2 class="introduction__example-number">Example 2</h2>
          <p class="introduction__example-task">14 12.5 11 9.5 8 ?</p>
          <p class="introduction__answer">A. 6.5 B. 5.5 C. 7.5 D. 6</p>
          <p class="introduction__example-explanation">
            Answer A is correct. Explanation: the series is reducing by 1.5, so
            you should take 1.5 away from 8.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="introduction__example">
          <h2 class="introduction__example-number">Example 3</h2>
          <p class="introduction__example-task">1 3 7 15 31 ?</p>
          <p class="introduction__answer">A. 46 B. 62 C. 61 D. 63</p>
          <p class="introduction__example-explanation">
            Answer D is correct. Explanation: the gaps between the numbers are
            2, 4, 8 and 16, so what number would fill the gap between the last
            and the missing number? Alternatively, this series can be done by
            doubling each of the numbers in the series and adding 1.

          You have 10 minutes to do as much as you can. You must work as quickly
          and as accurately as you can. Remember, you are likely to need a piece
          of scrap paper and a pencil. Begin as soon as you are ready.

            To perform well on this test, you have to perceive how numbers
            relate to each other. As you will have realized, it is more than a
            test of arithmetic. In fact, many people who think that they are
            ‘terrible’ at arithmetic often surprise themselves by doing better
            on this test than they expect. Each series of numbers is like a code
            which contains a hidden message. You have to work out the
            relationship of the numbers with each other to deduce the answer. It
            is a logical exercise, without the subtleties of interpretation
            needed in the test of verbal penetration. The aptitude for
            discovering the logic in a series of pieces of connected information
            is essential in many areas of work. These are often the mathematical
            sciences where quantification and precise technical information
            exchange are required. This aptitude is found in statistically-based
            commercial activities as well as most highly technical and
            research-based ones.
